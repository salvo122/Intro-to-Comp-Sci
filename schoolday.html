 <h2>What Happened?</h2>
  <p>
  This day was on 9/21/22. This would probably not makes sense because I had a test for every class period that I had. I had a chemistry test and an AP Calc test. Although,it was really fun because I studied and they weren't very hard at all, so I got a confidence boost from that. To add onto that during lunch I watched an episode of One Piece with Micah and it was really funny.
  This comedic episode was needed after a full day of tests and hard work.

  <h2> AP Calculus AB Test</h2>
  <p>
    Our test was only on derivatives and nothing else. Although we couldn't use the shortcut method that she would teach leter, instead we had to use the long and tedious formula shown below. It was long, but a fun
    process and I did well on the test.

  <h2> Chemistry Test</h2>
  <p>
  This chemistry test was surpisingly easy and it covered all of unit 1. Our teacher Mr. Gao made it really as it was all multiple choice and we were tested on basic knowledge
  basically an easy A for my chemistry grade.
