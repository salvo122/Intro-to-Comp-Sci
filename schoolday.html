 <h2>What Happened?</h2>
  <p>
  This day was on 9/21/22. This would probably not makes sense because I had a test for every class period that I had. I had a chemistry test and an AP Calc test. Although,it was really fun because I studied and they weren't very hard at all, so I got a confidence boost from that. To add onto that during lunch I watched an episode of One Piece with Micah and it was really funny.
  This comedic episode was needed after a full day of tests and hard work.

  <h2> AP Calculus AB</h2>

    Our test was only on derivatives and nothing else. Although we couldn't use the shortcut method that she would teach leter, instead we had to use the long and tedious formula shown below.
